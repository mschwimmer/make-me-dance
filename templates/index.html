    <h1>What does this website do?</h1>
    <p>Spotify has their own secret formula, much like the Krabby Patty from Spongebob<br>
        However, this secret formula doesn't create the best sandwich in Bikini Bottom<br>
        No, this formula creates a "Danceability Score" for each song<br>
        1 is the most danceable song in the world (think ABBA)<br>
        0 is the least danceable song in the world (think ABBA)</p><br>

    <h2>Al Green - Let's Stay Together</h2>
    <p>Spotify gives this song a 0.756</p>

    <h2>Claude Debussy - Clair de Lune</h2>
    <p>Spotify gives this song a 0.320</p>
